What is a comprehensive course:

DEFINITION: The "synthesis" of integrated courses has two meanings: not only to develop students' language skills, but also to provide skills training and to train the necessary basic materials-language knowledge; The contents of the integrated classes in different teaching stages include comprehensive knowledge of Chinese language, including speech, Grammar, vocabulary, paragraph, text and rhetoric, as well as the relevant cultural knowledge, which are all mathematics of the integrated curriculum, task one-to train students in Chinese language skills and language communication ability to provide the necessary materials. The second point is that the teaching task is comprehensive. The teaching task of the integrated course is not only to equip students with the ability to listen, speak and write four basic Chinese language skills but also to develop students' ability to communicate in Chinese, so the teaching task of each class is not single, it's a multiple, season-based aspartame. So, the third is the way of classroom training is comprehensive. In the comprehensive course, the comprehensive training method is decided by the teaching task of the comprehensive course, so, listening, speaking, reading and writing are not only the language skills of students but also the specific training methods and means used in the classroom.
